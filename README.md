   Shades countries based on total revenue generated.

3. **Country-wise Total Profits (Map)**  
   Shows geographic profitability insights.

4. **Item Type – Units Sold vs Total Cost (Bar Chart)**  
   Compares different product categories by units sold and associated costs.

5. **Region with Units Sold (Table)**  
   Ranks regions by total units sold.  
   📌 *Sub-Saharan Africa* leads with the highest units sold (182,870).
